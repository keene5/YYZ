        <h1>Formatting Demo Page</h1>
            <p1>This simple page demonstrates the formatting tags covered in this lesson.</p1>
            <h2><b><Strong>Bold and Strong </strong></b></h2>
            <b>This is Bold text</b>
            <p> The strong tag has the same visual effect as the bold tag but the strong tag also marks the enclosed text as more important. It is also easier for screen readers to read for the visually disabled.</p>
            <strong>this is what Strong looks like</strong>
            <H2><i><em>This is what italics and emphasis looks like</em></i></h2>
            <i>this is italics</i>
            <em>this is emphasis</em>
            <h2><script><sup> his is super and subscript</sup>;</script></h2>
            <h2><ins> Inserted</ins></h2>
            <h2><ins> <del> Inserted and deleted</del></ins></h2>
            <p>  Inserted text looks like this:  <ins>This is inserted.</ins></p>
            <p1>Here is  <del>deleted</del></p1>
            <p>Marked text looks like this.  <mark> this is marked</mark></p>
            <h2>BlockQuote</h2>
            <p> Blockedquote looks like this <blockquote> This is blocked quote</blockquote></p>
            <h2> Code</h2>
            <p>This is Code. <code>Fori=0;ivvvvv;i++ </code></p>
