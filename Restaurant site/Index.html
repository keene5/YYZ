   <div id = "ContentArea2" ><p id="history" > Frosty’s Donut Shop was established in 1965 in Brunswick, Maine by Bob and June Frost. Their famous donuts and welcoming atmosphere led to a faithful following of customers who made a stop at Frosty’s a part of their daily routine or reason for a special trip to Brunswick. Over the past 50 years, Frosty’s has become regarded as an “iconic institution” in the community and has attained regional and national recognition by Downeast, Travel & Leisure, and Saveur magazines.

In the fall of 2011 loyal customers, Nels and Shelby Omdal, purchased Frosty’s. Nels, with a background in food production and restaurant management, and Shelby, with experience in business and finance, knew that they had the skills and drive needed to make Frosty’s a success in Brunswick and the vision for growth. Frosty’s now operates four retail locations throughout Maine and delivers their delectable breakfast items to over 40 locations throughout the state.</p></div>
